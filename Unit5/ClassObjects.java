/*
CLASSES and OBJECTS


Creating New Object (instance) of type Person
Person p = new Person();

Declare the new object
p.name = "Dr.Kessner"

then Run: p.hello();


property and function

never going to use public variables
use public functions


Constructor
  speacil function when you construct an Object
  new object = call the Constructor
  like last year

  public Person(String nameIn){
      name = nameIn;
    }

   init in here

Clases are in one file
Main Function in another

Compile other, it'll automatically compile both
  I think

in class, order doesn't matter

Acsesor function
  Acces to private variable
  doesn't let you change it

*/



/*
UNIT TESTS


goes in not the class

expected is the same as the variable in the class
same for result
  given object.the function

testArea(c1, 314.159);
  objects then wanted/expected

if(Math.abs(result - expectedArea) < 0.001)
  Absolute value
