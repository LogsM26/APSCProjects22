NOTES


PApplet.main("Class");

PApplet is a main class for all Processing
  needs PApplet to run any processing functions

main goes inside the public Class

put all private variables into constructor without in

this. used for member varible

add display in class not the overall Class

add PApplet p variable to constructor

use p.processing function in classes that dont extend PApplet

create classes varibales in specific function in the main classes

when creating a class object, it needs the reference to the PApplet so just say this
  reference is the main class
  calling it to me/the class it's in

call dispay in draw

anything that needs a processing function requres the PAppley reference p.
