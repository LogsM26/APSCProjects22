/*
NOTES FOR STRINGS:

String is stored in a seperate box [String Object], array of letters
  Each has an index, starts a 0
  Length is one past the end
Variable is reference to it

Can call Functions/Method with the String variable
String + Int = String + String = Concadination

substring(0,5);
  0 = start
  5 = one past end

ASCII Table
  Upercase is different from Lowercase

Comparing the characters versus comparing the arrays/places in memory

/*
NOTES FOR MATH:

Math Library is already preprogrammed
  "Radians are natural for math.
  Degrees are made up by the Babalonyans"
    - Dr. Kessner

  "We should make a solar system!"
    - Sarah Siegal

Math is Capatilized
  Class not an Object
  Math.cos() is a Static Function
    Belongs to Class, opposed to an object

e and pi are Static Variables
  Cannot be changed

log 10 (100) = 2
log 10 (1000) = 3
  opposite of exponential
  Watch the Base, noramally e

E symbolizes Scientific Notation in Terminal
1e - 6 == 1.0e -6 == 0.000001 (ish)

Roundoff Error!!!
  Testing for Equalities
  Absolute Value and Subtraction
    Floating point numbers need a Fuzzy Test instead

Math.random() is a double
  Math.random() is between 0-1
  Math.random() * 100 is between 0-100
  Math.random() * 100 + 100 is between 100-200
  int result = (int)(Math.random() * 100 + 100);
    int cast

  Can get bottom value but not top value
    with cast
