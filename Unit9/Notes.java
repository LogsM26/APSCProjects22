/*

NOTES:


Same syntax as 7&8
  ArrayLists as input AND OUTPUT


filter function
  Delcare Result variable as an ARRAYLIST instead
  iterate through in a for each loop
  if statement
  spit out the ones that meet the requiremnts into a NEW ARRAYLIST
  use .add() function


transform functions
  the example int[] one is only cuz we know the length
  declare new Array

  use a regular for loop
    represents the length
    add the result[i] to names[i].length
      [] is the index

  return new Array


generate and return list of first n fizzbuzz strings
  result ArrayList
  for loop that runs n times
  if statemnet
    .add to the ArrayList made
    else .add the number: result.add("" + i);
